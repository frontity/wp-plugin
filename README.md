## Description ##

**[Frontity](https://frontity.com/?utm_source=plugin-repository&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=plugin-description)** (or WordPress PWA) is a plugin that adds a Progressive Web App (PWA) theme for mobile visitors to your site.

Suitable for WordPress blogs and news sites, this theme makes your site faster and more engaging on mobile devices. It also supports Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages).

A Progressive Web App (PWA) theme is a great way to offer an outstanding mobile experience for your users as it combines the best of mobile web and the best of mobile apps.
