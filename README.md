Make your mobile site fast and highly engaging with a Progressive Web App (PWA) theme built with React.

## Description ##

**[Frontity](https://frontity.com/?utm_source=plugin-repository&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=plugin-description)** (or WordPress PWA) is a plugin that adds a Progressive Web App (PWA) theme for mobile visitors to your site.

Suitable for **blogs and news sites**, this theme makes your site faster and more engaging on mobile devices.

A Progressive Web App (PWA) theme is a great way to improve site performance and offer an outstanding mobile experience for your users as it combines the best of mobile web and the best of mobile apps.

You can use web push notifications, let users experience instant loading times, swipe between articles, access your site from the home screen, among many things. This way, Frontity significantly helps to increase **user engagement**, **page views** per session, retention, and boost **revenue**.

In addition, Frontity combines the power of PWA technologies with Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages). You can enable this feature on your mobile site without any extra configuration and enjoy both PWA and AMP benefits.

### How does Frontity work? ###

* **Keep your desktop theme**: Frontity is a Progressive Web App (PWA) theme for mobile visitors - your desktop theme will not change and will continue to show for your non-mobile visitors.

* **Same URL**: Frontity uses the same URL as your regular theme. When a visit comes from a mobile device, it automatically loads the PWA theme.

* **Control what to display**: you can choose what to display in your menu (lists of posts, pages, categories) and exclude specific URLs from being loaded into the PWA theme.

* **Customize appearance**: change theme color, your logo, link styles, size of featured images, and other graphic elements to match your blog’s identity.

* **The latest PWA technologies**: we use the latest JavaScript Frameworks (ReactJS) to deliver the best progressive web apps experiences.

* **Use web push notifications**: keep readers engaged and notified of new posts with instant web notifications that pop up on their mobile device.

* **Improve UX and reduce bounce rates**: infinite and horizontal scrolling allow to instantly navigate between posts, categories, or pages. This app-like design keeps users engage with your blog and reduces bounce rates. 

* **Get more traffic and revenue**: speed is key for publishers nowadays. Frontity's features have been proved to increase page views per visit and boost revenue.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### How do I get a Site ID? ###

First, install the plugin like any other WordPress plugin and activate it. Then click the Frontity menu entry and fill out the form to request a Site ID.

Please note our PWA theme is suitable for **blogs, news sites and magazines**. It is not compatible with e-commerce, corporate, classifieds, or custom WordPress sites.

### Can I view a demo? ###

Sure, go to **[frontity.com/demo](https://frontity.com/demo?utm_source=plugin-repository&utm_medium=demo-link&utm_campaign=plugin-description)** and fill out the required fields to view your demo. Please note that **not all Frontity’s features** are shown in the basic demo.

### Is Frontity compatible with third-party plugins? ###

Frontity uses the REST API to take the content from your WordPress site and display it in a client-side rendered PWA. If a third-party plugin is compatible with the REST API, it should be compatible with ours as well. But it really depends on each plugin.

Frontity is compatible with some of the most popular plugins, such as YOAST SEO. It does not support, however, those third-party plugins that implement major features such as WooCommerce.

### Why mobile speed is important? ###

According to Google, 53% of visitors leave a mobile site after 3 seconds if the content doesn’t load quickly. No one likes to stare at an empty screen waiting for pages to load.

These users who are frustrated by a slow-loading site are more likely to bounce: visit your site once, leave and never return.

If you don’t want to lose more traffic, you need to prioritize your mobile performance. Speed is key to keep users engaged, which results in greater pageviews and ad revenue, among many other benefits.
